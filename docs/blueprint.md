# **App Name**: Siomai Messenger Bridge

## Core Features:

- Hero Section with Messenger CTA: Prominently display a mouthwatering photo of the Siomai Meal Box with a headline and subheadline emphasizing freshness and affordability. A large, sticky 'Order via Messenger' CTA button will open a Messenger chat directly.
- Box Options Display: Showcase 3-4 neatly arranged cards representing different Siomai Box options (Solo, Barkada, Party), each featuring a photo, short tagline, and price. The 'Order via Messenger' button autofills a message indicating the desired box.
- Trust Builders Section: Display icons and brief text highlighting key benefits such as freshness, fast delivery, and value for money to build trust. The key for this feature is keeping the explanations concise to encourage clicking on the CTA.
- Social Proof Carousel: Integrate a carousel displaying 2-3 short customer reviews with photos to demonstrate satisfaction and encourage conversions. Display testimonials like: 'Super sulit! Perfect for lunch sa office. Order ulit bukas!' - Maria G.
- Promo Section with Messenger Claim: Feature limited-time promotions (e.g., free Iced Tea with every Solo Box order) with a 'Claim in Messenger' CTA that opens a direct chat.
- Sticky Floating Messenger Button: Implement a persistent floating Messenger button (e.g., 'Chat to Order') in the bottom-right corner to ensure constant visibility and easy access for users to initiate a conversation.
- Mobile Optimization: Optimize the entire website for mobile devices with large, tap-friendly buttons, short text, and prominent food photos. Each section ends with a 'Order via Messenger' CTA to streamline the conversion process on mobile.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant teal (#008080) to represent freshness and a modern feel. This unexpected choice for a food app will help it stand out.
- Secondary color: A cheerful coral (#FF7F50) to evoke appetite and excitement. Use this for key CTAs and accents to draw the user's eye.
- Background color: A light and airy cream (#FFFDD0) to provide a clean backdrop and make the vibrant primary and secondary colors pop.
- Headline font: 'Lobster' (a display font) to inject personality and a playful vibe. Use sparingly for headlines and short impactful text.
- Body font: 'Nunito' (sans-serif) for excellent readability and a friendly, approachable feel. Ensures a smooth reading experience for longer text sections.
- Use hand-drawn style icons to add a unique and personal touch. Icons should be simple, easily recognizable, and aligned with the overall playful aesthetic.
- Maintain a single-column layout for mobile-first optimization. Incorporate playful geometric shapes and dividers to add visual interest without cluttering the page.
- Employ subtle but engaging animations. Consider a slight 'bounce' effect on the 'Order via Messenger' button or a fun transition when scrolling between sections.
